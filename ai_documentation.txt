You might notice that I have a weird series of duplicate commits when adding the environment.yml file. This is because, at some point, I accidentally created an orphaned branch. I couldn't figure out what was going on, and stackoverflow was not revealing answers. I asked ChatGPT for some help—it was a bad prompt, but it got me pointed in the right direction, which is what I needed.

Prompt: I am working in github. I have added a new file. When I stage my commit, tag it, and then push it with the tag, a tag is created on a separate tree but not on main. Still, github only shows one branch, which is main. Where is my commit going?

Response:

That’s a really good observation — what you’re seeing is actually a fairly common situation in Git when a **commit isn’t attached to any branch** (also known as a “dangling” commit or “orphan” commit), but is still **reachable through a tag**.

Let’s unpack what’s happening step by step.

---

## 🧭 Likely Scenario

You did something like:

```bash
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "Add new file"
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

but **you didn’t push the branch** itself (e.g. `main`).

So:

* ✅ A new commit was created locally.
* ✅ A tag pointing to that commit was created locally.
* ✅ You pushed the **tag**.
* ❌ But the commit is **not part of `main` on the remote**, because `main` itself was never updated with this commit.

This means:

* The remote now has a commit object (because the tag references it).
* The tag `v1.0` points to this commit.
* `main` on GitHub hasn’t moved — so when you look at the **branch view**, nothing changed.
* When you look at **tags**, you’ll see your commit.

This is why it “looks like” your commit went to a separate tree — it did. It’s not on any branch, just reachable by the tag.

## 🧪 How to Check This Locally

Run:

```bash
git log --decorate --graph --oneline --all
```

This will show where the tag is and where `main` is.
You’ll likely see something like:

```
abcd123 (tag: v1.0) Add new file
1234abc (origin/main, main) Previous commit
```

Notice how the tag is ahead of main, but main hasn’t moved.

---

## 🧩 How to Fix It (If You Want the Commit on `main`)

You have two options:

### Option 1: Push your `main` branch too

If your local `main` already includes that commit:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Now `main` on GitHub will include that commit, and the tag will be attached to a commit in the branch history.

---

### Option 2: Create a new branch at the tag (if it’s not on main)

If you committed while in a detached HEAD or some other branch:

```bash
git branch main v1.0   # or whatever branch you want
git push origin main
```

Or if you want to merge the tag’s commit into main:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge v1.0
git push origin main
```

## 🧭 Why GitHub Shows Only One Branch

GitHub lists only branches — not detached commits — in the branch view.
The commit exists remotely (because of the tag) but is **not part of any branch**, so:

* GitHub won’t show it under “main” history.
* You can only access it by looking at the tag or commit hash directly.

---

✅ **Summary**

* Your commit was pushed via a tag only, so it’s not on `main`.
* It’s stored on GitHub but not part of a branch.
* To make it visible in your branch history, push or merge it into `main`.

---

If you paste the output of:

```bash
git branch
git status
git log --oneline --decorate --graph -n 5
```

I can tell you exactly where your commit currently “lives” in the tree. Would you like to share that?
